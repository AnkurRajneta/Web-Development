        From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br>
        <p>Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia (born 9 September 1967),[4] known professionally as Akshay Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj
            kʊˈmɑːɾ]), is an Indian-born naturalised Canadian[1][2][3] actor, film producer, martial artist and
            television personality who works in Bollywood, the commercial Hindi language film industry based mainly in
            Mumbai. Over 29 years, Kumar has appeared in over 100 films and has won several awards, including a National
            Film Award for Best Actor and two Filmfare Awards. Kumar is one of the most successful prolific actors of
            Hindi cinema.[5][6] Having starred in 113 films, 52 of which were commercially successful, he was the first
            Bollywood actor whose films' domestic net lifetime collections crossed ₹20 billion (US$280 million) by 2013,
            and ₹30 billion (US$420 million) by 2016.[7][8][9]

            Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005). While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits in India; it was consistent until a short period of professional setbacks between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time the critical response to several of his films improved; after favourable reviews came his way for his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby and Airlift (2016), he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for the social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018) and the war film Kesari (2019).
